# Dog Party Website
This project "Dog Party" was made using html, CSS, and Javascript. Media queries were used to make the site responsive to iPhone 6,7, and 8. The website is about dogs.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to have the designer replicate a pre-existing site. Without using FlexBox or CSS Grid, the designer modeled this sight based on an image of another site.
